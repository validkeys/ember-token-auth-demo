# ember-token-auth-demo

*The goal here is to use Ember-Simple-Auth on the front end and and Rails JWT on the backend. Would also be nice to then extend this to use Torii and Omniauth for social login*

_Resources_:
* (ember-cli-simple-auth-token)[https://github.com/jpadilla/ember-cli-simple-auth-token]


1. Start by installing ember-simple auth

```
npm install --save-dev ember-cli-simple-auth
ember generate ember-cli-simple-auth
```

2. Then install ember-cli-simple-auth-token
```
npm install --save-dev ember-cli-simple-auth-token
ember generate simple-auth-token
```
